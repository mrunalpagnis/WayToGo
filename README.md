# WayToGo
This is my first GO project where I will be learning various concepts of the GO programming language. 
I am currently referring to the book 'The Go programming language' by Alan A. A. Donovan, Brian W. Kernighan.

The exercise module contains solutions to exercises given in each chapter in the book.
In order to run the programs which use command line arguments, I have configured the run in intellij with Program Arguments setting.
